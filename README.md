# ECE-128-Lab-2
The purpose of this lab was to design and implement a one-bit full adder an four-bit full adders, using the Carry Look Ahead adder and Ripple Carry adder designs, onto a FPGA board. Specifically, for the one-bit full adder, its truth table and block diagram aided in the Verilog implementation. For the four-bit full adder designs, two different architectures were explored that both cascaded the one-bit full adder module four times. By synthesizing and testing both four-bit full adder designs on the FPGA board, the lab emphasized the practical differences between the Ripple Carry and Carry Look Ahead approaches. Additionally, simulations and resource utilization analysis provided insight into the performance and hardware tradeoffs between the designs.
1.) In the constraint dropdown add the constraint file 2.) Compile project: Create 3 different .vfiles and copy the OneBitFA, FourBitFARippleCarry, and FourBitFARippleCarryLookAhead 3.) Run these steps 4.) Generate Bitstream 5.) Copy the testbench to test code before programming the FPGA board 6.) Program the board
